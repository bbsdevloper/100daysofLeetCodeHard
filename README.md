  <h1>100 Days of LeetCode Hard</h1>

  <h2>Motivation</h2>

  <p>The primary goal of this challenge is to improve my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of complex algorithms and data structures. By tackling LeetCode hard problems on a daily basis, I aim to enhance my ability to analyze problems, design efficient solutions, and write clean and optimized code.</p>

  <h2>Repository Structure</h2>

  <p>Each day is represented by a separate directory (Day01 to Day100). Inside each day's directory, you will find a directory for each problem solved on that day. Each problem directory contains the solution code (solution.py) and a detailed README (README.md) explaining the problem statement, approach, and any additional notes.</p>

  <h2>Problem Sources</h2>

  <p>The problems solved during this challenge are sourced from the LeetCode platform's hard-level category. Each day, I will select a new problem to solve and document my progress in the corresponding README file.</p>

  <h2>Progress Tracking</h2>

  <p>To keep track of my progress throughout the challenge, I will maintain a log file named <code>progress.md</code> in the root of the repository. This file will contain a day-by-day summary of the problems solved, the concepts learned, and any reflections or insights gained during the journey.</p>

  <h2>Join Me</h2>

  <p>If you are interested in participating in the challenge or following along with my progress, feel free to fork this repository or simply keep an eye on the updates. I welcome any suggestions, improvements, or collaborations, so don't hesitate to reach out!</p>

  <p>Let's embark on this exciting 100-day coding journey together!</p>

  <p>Happy coding!</p>
